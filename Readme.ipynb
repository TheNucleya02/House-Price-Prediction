    "Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:\n",
    "* The number of rooms\n",
    "* The distance to employment centres\n",
    "* How rich or poor the area is\n",
    "* How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc\n",

    "2. Split your data for training and testing\n",
